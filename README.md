## z180emu
A portable full system emulator of Z180 based boards

This is a fork of mtdev79/z180emu, the main addition being a debugger. It is invoked either by pressing escape when running the emulator, or by starting it with -d. The tracing, which the original emulator featured instead, has been removed.

Also, as I don't have windows, this fork only builds and runs on linux.

Original README follows.

## z180emu
A portable full system emulator of Z180 based boards

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to provide a fast, complete and accurate emulated development environment for Z180 boards. It is especially useful for BIOS, OS and ROM debugging, but can also be used to run and develop user programs.

## Build status
**build passing**
There is no CI yet.  
Supported targets are MinGW and Linux. gcc-win64-mingw64 and gcc-linux-amd64 are actively developed and tested. gcc-win32-mingw32, gcc-linux-i686 and gcc-linux-armhf should work without any issues, but are not tested.  
Currently used compiler versions:  
x86_64-w64-mingw32 gcc version 6.2.0 (Rev2, Built by MSYS2 project)	- used for primary development  
x86_64-linux-gnu gcc version 6.3.0 20170516 (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1)  


## Code style
C89  
I convert all upstream C++ code to pure C. I generally find emulators easier to write and debug in C than C++.  
C is also more portable as there is no libstdc++ dependency.

## Features
### General  
**Fairly well-debugged and accurate Z180/Z182 core**  
-2 PRT timers  
-2channel DMA  
-2channel ASCI **(new!)**  
-Z182 mode enables additional peripherals **(new!)**: PA,PB,PC, ROMBR/RAMUBR/RAMLBR, 80230 2channel ESCC. (16550 MIMIC is unimplemented but can be added. IOCS is hardcoded)  
**FDC37C665 SuperIO**  
-4port NEC uPD-765 FDC (with both PIO and DMA support)  
-3.5/5.25 FDD with many DD and HD formats  
-fdimage format: raw IMG/IMA/BIN/VFD (additional such as IMD, FDI, D86F can be ported)  
-dual 16550  
-IEEE1284 LPT (unimplemented)  
-IDE ATA controller (purposefully disabled, 16bit only)  
**standalone 16-bit ATA, 8-bit XT and 8-bit latched PIO IDE**  
-CompactFlash, GIDE, ZIDE (other can be ported)  
**DS1202/1302 RTC with NVRAM file storage**  
**Z180 dissasembler and simple yet powerful tracer**  
Serial ports are implemented as **byte-oriented streams over a raw TCP socket** (works with Putty, nc, ckermit etc.)  
**Modular structure** allowing adding new boards and peripherals with reasonable effort  


### Boards/ROM/OS support
**P112 (stable):**  
-original Dave Brooks' 19960513 and 19970308 ROM - not working, TODO  
-Hal Bower's 19970712 4.1 ROM - OK  
-Hector Peraza's 20060205 and 20070217 5.1 ROM - OK  
-Terry Gulczynski/Wayne Warthen's 20161213 5.8 ROM - OK  
-original Dave Brooks' 19970308 CP/M 2.2 image - OK  
-Hector Peraza's CP/M 2.2 20070805 image - only works with 4.x ROM, probably CP/M BIOS bug  
-Hector Peraza's CP/M 3.0 / ZPM3 20070817 image	- OK  
-Hector Peraza's MP/M 2.1 20070817 image - OK  
-Hector Peraza's UZI180 20070805 image - OK  
-Hector Peraza's RSX180 20181105 tt image - OK  
-David Griffith's 20111130 ZSDOS image - OK  
-Terry Gulczynski's 20170130 ZSDOS image - OK  
**MarkIV (alpha):**  
-UNABIOS 3.47beta with UNACPM (512k ROM) - OK  


### TODO
Emulator console ala SimH  
Change fdimage at runtime  
Interactive debugger (display/edit/disasm/asm/single/breakpoint)  
SDcard emulation  
Clock-accurate emulation of FDC 16550 and ASCI  
LPT?  

## Installation
```
git clone
make
```

You get the p112, markiv and makedisk binaries.

## API Reference

## Tests

## How to use?
Run without trace:  
P112:  
copy your rom to p112rom.bin  
copy your fdd boot image to p112-fdd1.img  
[optional] create a hdd image using makedisk and cpmtools, and name it ide00.dsk  
```
p112
```


The emulator opens with:
```
z180emu v1.0 P112
Serial port 0 listening on 10180
Serial port 1 listening on 10181
```
waits until both sockets are connected, and then starts execution.

---  
Mark IV:  
copy your rom to markivrom.bin  
[optional] create a CF image using makedisk and cpmtools, and name it cf00.dsk  
```
markiv
```
and connect to the console socket.  
Non-LBA drives do not report capacity correctly. This seems to be a DualIDE driver issue.  


---
Run with trace:  
```
p112 d >mytrace.log
```
Then grep for it.


Run with trace from 10000000-th instruction:  
```
p112 d 10000000 >mytrace.log
```
The above can be used to bisect into the routine you're debugging.  

---
Exiting the emulator  
CTRL+C/SIGINT is completely disabled to allow ^C passthrough to the emulated system, esp. in case socket console isn't used.  
The emulator can be exited by CTRL+Break (or closing the window) on MinGW, and CTRL+\ (SIGQUIT) on POSIX systems.  

---
Socket console  
If using Putty, set Connection type to "Raw".  
For nc, use  
```
stty raw -echo; nc -C 127.0.0.1 10180
```
